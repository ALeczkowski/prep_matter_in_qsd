## While the code is already published here, preposition sense annotations will be provided till the end of October 2022.

Whilst the corpus cannot be shared at this point, this repository provides our preposition sense annotations and code necessary to replicate our results reported in the paper cited below. Access to the corpus can be requested by writing email to the second author of our paper (j.grudzinska@uw.edu.pl) after obtaining permissions from the copyright holders: Law School Admission Council and Adrian Brasoveanu, who represents the authors of the 2012 scope-disambiguated corpus.
